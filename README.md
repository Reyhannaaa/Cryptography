# Cryptography
Codes in this repository implemented for Cryptography course in university
 
 In this implementation I used AES protocol to encrypt and decrypt 
 
 ### Encrypt code
 This code is implemented in the way that you give a text that you want to encrypt it and a key. 
 In the output you see encrypted text.
 
 
 ### Decrypt code
 This code is implemented in the way that you give a text that is encrypted and a key at first.  (btw it should be 128 bits)
 In the output you see decrypted text.
